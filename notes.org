  Watch Robbie solve Wordle.  You can choose among several different
  criteria he uses--these will affect the kinds of risks he'll take to
  try and solve the puzzle in as few steps as possible.

** Criteria
   Here are some different criteria that Robbie will attempt to
   minimize on each turn.  Uncomment the one you want, or accept the
   default. 
#+begin_src ipython
from wordle_optimizer import quantile_criterion, mean, mse, crra

# criterion = mean # Minimize expected length of list after guess
# criterion = mse  # Minimize expected length squared of list after guess (more risk-averse)

# Change the number to something smaller (in (0,1) to make Robbie more risk-seeking.
# criterion = quantile_criterion(0.5)  

# Pick a negative number for risk-seeking, positive for risk-averse
# criterion = crra(1.0)

** Autoplay

#+begin_src ipython
from wordle_optimizer import Answers, Guesses, autoplay

# Set to True to see lists of remaining possible answers after each guess
verbose = False 

guess = None  # Supply an initial guess here if you wish...

autoplay()
